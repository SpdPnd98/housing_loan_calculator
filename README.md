# Home Loan Calculator

There are many home loan calculators available online. However, I wasn't able to find one that includes potential increase in interest rates, so I made one myself.

NOTE: when adding variable interest rates, it might be possible to reach a negative balance. Usually this amount is small so feel free to ignore it. Do raise an issue if the value is unusually negative.

# How to use
Edit `config/housing.yaml` 

Run the following: `python3 housing.py`
